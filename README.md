#### PhantomJS
Full web stack
No browser required
PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. It has fast andnative support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.

#### immutable-js
Immutable provides Persistent Immutable List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record. They are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.

#### ReactJS
* JUST THE UI
Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.
* VIRTUAL DOM
React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native.
* DATA FLOW
React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

#### Flux
Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow. It's more of a pattern rather than a formal framework, and you can start using Flux immediately without a lot of new code.
